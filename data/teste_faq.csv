The shoe is not the correct size
Generally, if the shoe is a bit large, friction occurs during wear and causes holes in the lining
Holes may form in the lining near the heel, around the collar, or near the toe
Wearing the wrong shoe for your gait
Lack of technology needed to correct over or under pronation may cause friction or stress on the lining of the shoe
Stepping on the back of each shoe to take it off, especially without untying or loosening them first
Causes friction around the collar and the inside of the heel
This stress may also cause the lining to pull away from the upper
Machine washing or drying shoes
Loosens the inner lining
Weakens all materials in the shoe

There is approximately a 1/2"" difference between widths (2A, B, D, 2E and 4E) and a 3/8"" difference between 4E and 6E width

Length:
There is approximately a 1/6"" difference between each half-size (e.g., between 9 and 9.5, between a 9.5 and a 10, and so on)
For every half size up, the width (across the ball) will increase by 1/8""

25,Sports Bra Size Guide,"To calculate bra size:

Band Size: measure your rib cage directly under the breast, the tape measure should be level around your body, take a snug measurement. Add 5 to this measurement and round down to the nearest even number to determine your band size.
Example =30 + 5, round down to 34 Your band size is 34.
Overbust Measurement: measure around the fullest part of the breast again keeping the tape measure level the tape measure should not compress the breast.
Cup Size: Subtract your band size from the overbust measurement; if the difference is 1= A cup,2 = B cup, 3 = C cup, 4 = D cup, 5 = DD cup
Example = Overbust measurement is 36 minus band size of 34 = 2, 2= B cup. Your bra size is
