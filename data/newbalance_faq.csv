What activities am I using the shoe for?
Using a shoe for its unintended purpose can cause a shoe to wear faster than you may expect
Running and walking shoes are designed for forward movements. They are not recommended for gym workouts or such as tennis or soccer, as these activities usually require a lot of side to side and pivoting movements

We recommend cross-trainers for gym workouts, weightlifting, and other activities that involve side to side movements
You can walk in any style of shoe, including running shoes or cross-trainers

The shoe is not the correct size
Generally, if the shoe is a bit large, friction occurs during wear and causes holes in the lining
Holes may form in the lining near the heel, around the collar, or near the toe
Wearing the wrong shoe for your gait
Lack of technology needed to correct over or under pronation may cause friction or stress on the lining of the shoe
Stepping on the back of each shoe to take it off, especially without untying or loosening them first
Causes friction around the collar and the inside of the heel
This stress may also cause the lining to pull away from the upper
Machine washing or drying shoes
Loosens the inner lining
Weakens all materials in the shoe

There is approximately a 1/2"" difference between widths (2A, B, D, 2E and 4E) and a 3/8"" difference between 4E and 6E width

Length:
There is approximately a 1/6"" difference between each half-size (e.g., between 9 and 9.5, between a 9.5 and a 10, and so on)
For every half size up, the width (across the ball) will increase by 1/8""

Band Size: measure your rib cage directly under the breast, the tape measure should be level around your body, take a snug measurement. Add 5 to this measurement and round down to the nearest even number to determine your band size.
Example =30 + 5, round down to 34 Your band size is 34.
Overbust Measurement: measure around the fullest part of the breast again keeping the tape measure level the tape measure should not compress the breast.
Cup Size: Subtract your band size from the overbust measurement; if the difference is 1= A cup,2 = B cup, 3 = C cup, 4 = D cup, 5 = DD cup
Example = Overbust measurement is 36 minus band size of 34 = 2, 2= B cup. Your bra size is

155,Wear Questions: How Should I Clean My New Balance Shoes?,"The suggested cleaning method for New Balance athletic shoes:
Use a light bristle brush (an old toothbrush works well) and a mild detergent (either dishwashing or laundry)
Be sure to use a detergent free of dye to avoid staining
We recommend spot check with the detergent to ensure no staining will occur
Scrub the shoes with the brush and use a damp cloth to wipe clean
Allow the shoes to thoroughly air dry for 24 hours
To eliminate and prevent shoe odor, use a shoe deodorizer spray
Putting shoes through a washing machine cycle is NOT recommended, as some shoe materials should not be exposed to heat or submerged in water

When purchasing a cleaning product:
Be sure that it is silicone-based to prevent any possible damage to your shoes
Suede or leather shoes require suede or leather cleaner, respectively

*For best results, always follow the instructions included with the cleaning product*
